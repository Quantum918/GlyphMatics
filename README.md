# GlyphMatics
GlyphMatic: a formal software identity system by Matthew Blake Ward (918). It uses 111 glyphs and calculus ℛ to encode systems into canonical, reversible sigils. Guarantee: compute_sigil(rehydrate(S))==S. This mathematically proves identity, solving supply chain security, reproducible builds, compliance. Sigils are compact, content-addressable.
